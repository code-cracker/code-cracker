# Code Cracker

An analyzer library for C# that uses [Roslyn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/roslyn.aspx) to produce refactorings, code analysis, and other niceties.

Check the official project site on [code-cracker.github.io](http://code-cracker.github.io) (still under construction).

This is a community project, free and open source. Everyone is invited to contribute, fork, share and use the code. No money shall be charged by this
software, nor it will be. Ever.

## Installing

You may use CodeCracker in two ways: as an analyzer library that you install with Nuget into your project or as a Visual Studio extension.
The way you want to use it depends on the scenario you are working on. You most likely want the Nuget package.

If you want the analyzers to work during your build, and generate warnings and errors during the build, also on build servers, then you want
to use the Nuget package. The package is available on nuget at [nuget.org/packages/codecracker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/codecracker).
If you want to be able to configure which analyzers are being used in your project, and which ones you will ignore, and commit those
changes to source control and share with your team, then you also want the Nuget package.

To install from Nuget:

```powershell
Install-Package CodeCracker
```

Or use the Package Manager in Visual Studio.

If you want global analyzers that will work on every project you open in Visual Studio, then you want the Extension.
Grab the extension at the [Visual Studio Extensions Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ab588981-91a5-478c-8e65-74d0ff450862).

To build from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker.git
cd CodeCracker
msbuild
```

Then add a reference to CodeCracker.dll from within the Analyzers node inside References, in Visual Studio.

## Issues and task board

* The task board is at [Huboard](http://huboard.com/code-cracker/code-cracker/board).
* You can also check the [Github backlog](https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker/issues) directly.

## Contributing

Questions, comments, bug reports, and pull requests are all welcome.
Bug reports that include steps-to-reproduce (including code) are the
best. Even better, make them in the form of pull requests.
Before you start to work on an existing issue, check if it is not assigned
to anyone yet, and if it is, talk to that person.
Also check the project [board](http://huboard.com/code-cracker/code-cracker/board)
and verify it is not being worked on (it will be tagged with the `Working` tag).
If it is not being worked on, before you start check if the item is `Ready`.
If the issue has the `Working` tag (working swimlane on Huboard) and has no Assignee
then it is not being worked on by somebody on the core team. Check the issue's
description to find out who it is (if it is not there it has to be on the comments).

### Definition of Ready (DoR)

An item should only have its work started after the backlog item is ready. We have
defined ready as:

1. Have most of the scenarios/test cases defined on the issue on Github
2. If it has an analyzer then
  1. The warning level of the analyzer must be in the issue's description (`Information`, `Warning`, or `Error`)
  2. The diagnostics it provides should already have numeric ids defined formated as `CC0000`.
3. If it has a code fix then the category should be in the issue's description. Which categories we are going to support is not clear at this moment so this point is not active at the moment and we are always using `Syntax`.
4. Have some of the maintainers verify it (cannot be the same one who wrote the issue and/or test cases)

The first one is important so we have clearly defined what we will build. The last one
is important so we don't go on building something that will not be usable, will hurt users, or will
be a waste of effort.

and [#10](https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker/issues/10).

#### Warning levels are:

1. **Info**: Just an alternative way (ex: replacing for with foreach). Clearly a matter of opinition. All options are correct.
2. **Warning**: Code that could/should be improved. It is a code smell and most likely is wrong, but there are situations where the pattern is acceptable or desired.
3. **Error**: Clearly a mistake (ex: throwing ArgumentException with an non-existent parameter). There is no situation where this code could be correct. There are no differences of opinion.


### Definition of Done

The DoD is still evolving. At the present time the checklist is as follows:

1. Builds
2. Has tests for analyzers, code fixes and refactoring (analyzers have to include test cases where they do not provide diagnostics as well)
3. All tests pass
4. Analyzers follow the guidelines for names
  1. Always named `<featurename>Analyzer`
  2. Always name the diagnostic ids formated as `CC0000`.
5. Code fixes should follow the guidelines for names
  1. Always named `<featurename>CodeFixProvider`
  2. Always export the name in the format `CodeCracker<featurename>CodeFixProvider`
5. Refactorings should follow the guidelines for names
  1. Always named `<featurename>CodeRefactoringProvider`
  2. Always name the refactoring id as `CodeCracker<featurename>`
6. Follow the coding standards present on the other code files.

### Start working

Once it is Ready and agreed on by any one of the maintainers, just state in
a comment that you intend to start working on that item and mention any/all
the maintainers (use @code-cracker/owners) so they can tag it correctly and move it on the board.

To start working fork the project on Github to your own account and clone it **from there**. Don't clone
from the main CodeCracker repository. Before you start coding create a new branch and name it in a way that makes
sense for the issue that you will be working on. Don't work on the `master` branch because that may make
things harder if you have to update your pull request or your repository later, assume your `master` branch
is always equals the main repo `master` branch, and code on a different branch.

When you commit, mention the issue number use the pound sign (#). Avoid making a lot of small commits
unless they are meaningful. For most analyzers and code fixes a single commit should be enough. If you
prefer to work with a lot commits at the end squash them.

Make your first commit lines mean something, specially the first one.
[Here](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message) and
[here](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) are some tips on a good
commit first line/message.

**Do not**, under any circumstance, reformat the code to fit your standards. Follow the project standards,
and if you do not agree with them discuss them openly with the Code Cracker community. Also, avoid end of line
white spaces at all costs. Keep your code clean.

Always write unit tests for your analyzers, code fixes and analyzers.

### Pull request

When you are done, pull the changes from the `master` branch on the main CodeCracker repo and integrate them.

You have to do that in the command line:
````bash
# add the main repo with the `codecracker` name
git remote add codecracker https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker.git
# checkout the master branch
git checkout master
# download the latest changes from the master repo
git pull codecracker master
# go back to your working branch
git checkout <youbranchname>
# integrate your changes
git merge master
# solve integration conflicts
````

You can solve the conflicts in your favorite text editor, or, if you are using Visual Studio, you can use it as well.
Visual Studio actually presents the conflict in a very nice way to solve them.
Also, on the `go back to your working branch` step you can go back to using Visual Studio to control git, if you
prefer that.

If you know git well, you can rebase your changes instead of merging them. If not, it is ok to merge them.
When your changes are up to date with the
`master` branch then you should push them to your Github repo and then you will be able to issue
a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and
mention the issue you were working on. Make your PR message clear. If when you are creating the pull request on
Github it mentions that the PR cannot be merged because there are conflicts it means you forgot to integrate
the `master` branch. Correct that and issue the PR again. The project maintainers should not have to resolve
merge conflicts, you should.

After your pull request is accepted you may delete your local branch if you want. Update your `master` branch
so you can continue to contribute in the future. And thank you! :)

If your pull request is denied try to understand why. It is not uncommon that PRs are denied but after some
discussing and fixing they are accepted. Work with the community to get it to be the best possible code. And thank you!

### Rules for contribution

* Every pull request must have unit tests. PRs without tests will be denied without checking anything else.
* Must build and all tests must pass
* Must mention an existing issue on Github
* Don't reformat any code but the one you produced
* Follow the coding standards already in place within the project
* One code issue per person at a time (blocked issues don't count)

If you work on something that you have not yet discussed with the maintainers
there is a chance the code might be denied.
They are easily reachable through Twitter or on Github. Before you code discuss it with it them.

Small code changes or updates outside code files will eventually be made by the core team directly on `master`, without a PR.
